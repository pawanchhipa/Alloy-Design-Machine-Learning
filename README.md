# Alloy Design and Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict the properties of alloys based on their composition. The focus is on developing regression models to accurately predict target properties using different approaches, including:
- Linear Regression with Analytical Solution (Normal Equation)
- Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
- Model evaluation using k-Fold Cross-Validation

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from the research article:
> Wen, Cheng, et al. "Machine learning assisted design of high entropy alloys with desired property." Acta Materialia 170 (2019): 109-117. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2019.03.010

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Simulated a dataset representing alloy compositions.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implemented linear regression models with analytical and gradient descent solutions.
- **Cross-Validation Analysis**: Used k-Fold Cross-Validation to evaluate model performance for various values of k.
- **Performance Comparison**: Compared coefficients obtained from the analytical solution vs. gradient descent.
